##API documentation

 Cloudbreak is a RESTful application development platform with the goal of helping developers to build solutions for deploying HDP clusters in different environments. Once it is deployed in your favourite servlet container it exposes a REST API allowing to span up Hadoop clusters of arbitary sizes and cloud providers.

The [API documentation](https://cloudbreak-api.sequenceiq.com/api/index.html) is generated from the code using [Swagger](http://swagger.io/).
