#Provisioning via Browser

You can log into the Cloudbreak application at http://PUBLIC_IP:3000.

The main goal of the Cloudbreak UI is to easily create clusters on your own cloud provider account.
This description details the AZURE setup - if you'd like to use a different cloud provider check out its manual.

This document explains the four steps that need to be followed to create Cloudbreak clusters from the UI:

- connect your AZURE account with Cloudbreak
- create some template resources on the UI that describe the infrastructure of your clusters
- create a blueprint that describes the HDP services in your clusters and add some recipes for customization
- launch the cluster itself based on these template resources

## Setting up Azure credentials

If you do not have an Azure Resource manager application you can simply create it with Cloudbreak deployer. Please read the [Provisioning prerequisites](azure_pre_prov.md) for more information.

`Name:` name of your credential

`Description:` short description of your linked credential

`Subscription Id:` your Azure subscription id - see Accounts (`portal.azure.com`> `Browse all`> `Subscription`)

`Password:` your password which was setted up when you create the AD app

`App Id:` You app Id (`portal.azure.com`> `Browse all`> `Subscription`> `Subscription detail`> `Users`> `You application`> `Properties`)

`App Owner Tenant Id:` You Tenant Id (`portal.azure.com`> `Browse all`> `Subscription`> `Subscription detail`> `Users`> `You application`> `Properties`)

`SSH public key:` the SSH public key in OpenSSH format that's private keypair can be used to log into the launched instances later

> Cloudbreak is supporting simple rsa public key instead of X509 certificate file after 1.0.4 version

The ssh username is **cloudbreak**

## Infrastructure templates

After your AZURE account is linked to Cloudbreak you can start creating templates that describe your clusters' infrastructure:

- resources
- networks
- security groups

When you create a template, Cloudbreak *doesn't make any requests* to AZURE.
Resources are only created on AZURE after the `create cluster` button is pushed.
These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's database and can be reused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure.

**Manage resources**

Using manage resources you can create infrastructure templates. Templates describes the infrastructure where the HDP cluster will be provisioned. We support heterogenous clusters - this means that one cluster can be built by combining different templates.

`Name:` name of your template

`Description:` short description of your template

`Instance type:` the Azure instance type to be used

`Attached volumes per instance:` the number of disks to be attached

`Volume size (GB):` the size of the attached disks (in GB)

`Public in account:` share it with others in the account

**Manage blueprints**

Blueprints are your declarative definition of a Hadoop cluster.

`Name:` name of your blueprint

`Description:` short description of your blueprint

`Source URL:` you can add a blueprint by pointing to a URL. As an example you can use this [blueprint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/master/core/src/main/resources/defaults/blueprints/multi-node-hdfs-yarn.bp).

`Manual copy:` you can copy paste your blueprint in this text area

`Public in account:` share it with others in the account

**Manage networks**

Manage networks allows you to create or reuse existing networks and configure them.

`Name:` name of the network

`Description:` short description of your network

`Subnet (CIDR):` a subnet in the VPC with CIDR block

`Address prefix (CIDR):` the address space that is used for subnets

`Public in account:` share it with others in the account

**Security groups**

They describe the allowed inbound traffic to the instances in the cluster.
Currently only one security group template can be selected for a Cloudbreak cluster and all the instances have a public IP address so all the instances in the cluster will belong to the same security group.
This may change in a later release.

You can define your own security group by adding all the ports, protocols and CIDR range you'd like to use. 443 needs to be there in every security group otherwise Cloudbreak won't be able to communicate with the provisioned cluster. The rules defined here doesn't need to contain the internal rules, those are automatically added by Cloudbreak to the security group on Azure.

You can also use the two pre-defined security groups in Cloudbreak:

`only-ssh-and-ssl:` all ports are locked down except for SSH and gateway HTTPS (you can't access Hadoop services outside of the VPC):

* SSH (22)
* HTTPS (443)

`all-services-port:` all Hadoop services and SSH/gateway HTTPS are accessible by default:

* SSH (22)
* HTTPS (443)
* Ambari (8080)
* Consul (8500)
* NN (50070)
* RM Web (8088)
* Scheduler (8030RM)
* IPC (8050RM)
* Job history server (19888)
* HBase master (60000)
* HBase master web (60010)
* HBase RS (16020)
* HBase RS info (60030)
* Falcon (15000)
* Storm (8744)
* Hive metastore (9083)
* Hive server (10000)
* Hive server HTTP (10001)
* Accumulo master (9999)
* Accumulo Tserver (9997)
* Atlas (21000)
* KNOX (8443)
* Oozie (11000)
* Spark HS (18080)
* NM Web (8042)
* Zeppelin WebSocket (9996)
* Zeppelin UI (9995)
* Kibana (3080)
* Elasticsearch (9200)

If `Public in account` is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this security group template to create clusters, but cannot delete or modify it.

Note that the security groups are *not created* on AZURE after the `Create Security Group` button is pushed, only after the cluster provisioning starts with the selected security group template.

## Cluster installation

This section describes

**Blueprints**

Blueprints are your declarative definition of a Hadoop cluster. These are the same blueprints that are [used by Ambari](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/Blueprints).

You can use the 3 default blueprints pre-defined in Cloudbreak or you can create your own.
Blueprints can be added from an URL or the whole JSON can be copied to the `Manual copy` field.

The hostgroups added in the JSON will be mapped to a set of instances when starting the cluster and the services and components defined in the hostgroup will be installed on the corresponding nodes.
It is not necessary to define all the configuration fields in the blueprints - if a configuration is missing, Ambari will fill that with a default value.
The configurations defined in the blueprint can also be modified later from the Ambari UI.

If `Public in account` is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this blueprint to create clusters, but cannot delete or modify it.

A blueprint can be exported from a running Ambari cluster that can be reused in Cloudbreak with slight modifications.
There is no automatic way to modify an exported blueprint and make it instantly usable in Cloudbreak, the modifications have to be done manually.
When the blueprint is exported some configurations will have for example hardcoded domain names, or memory configurations that won't be applicable to the Cloudbreak cluster.

**Cluster customization**

Sometimes it can be useful to define some custom scripts that run during cluster creation and add some additional functionality.
For example it can be a service you'd like to install but it's not supported by Ambari or some script that automatically downloads some data to the necessary nodes.
The most notable example is Ranger setup: it has a prerequisite of a running database when Ranger Admin is installing.
A PostgreSQL database can be easily started and configured with a recipe before the blueprint installation starts.

To learn more about these so called *Recipes*, and to check out the Ranger database recipe, take a look at the [Cluster customization](recipes.md) part of the documentation.


## Cluster deployment

After all the templates are configured you can deploy a new HDP cluster. Start by selecting a previously created credential in the header.
Click on `create cluster`, give it a `Name`, select a `Region` where the cluster infrastructure will be provisioned and select one of the `Networks` and `Security Groups` created earlier.
After you've selected a `Blueprint` as well you should be able to configure the `Template resources` and the number of nodes for all of the hostgroups in the blueprint.

If `Public in account` is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to see the newly created cluster on the UI, but cannot delete or modify it.

If `Enable security` is checked as well, Cloudbreak will install KDC and the cluster will be Kerberized. See more about it in the [Kerberos](kerberos.md) section of this documentation.

After the `create and start cluster` button is pushed Cloudbreak will start to create resources on your AZURE account.
Cloudbreak uses *ARM template* to create the resources - you can check out the resources created by Cloudbreak on the [ARM Portal](https://portal.azure.com) on the 'Resource groups' page.

**Important!** Always use Cloudbreak to delete the cluster, or if that fails for some reason always try to delete the ARM first.

**Advanced options**

There are some advanced features when deploying a new cluster, these are the following:

`File system:` read more [Deploying a DASH service with Cloudbreak deployer](azure_pre_prov.md)

`Minimum cluster size:` the provisioning strategy in case of the cloud provider can't allocate all the requested nodes

`Validate blueprint:` feature to validate or not the Ambari blueprint. By default is switched on.

`Consul server count:` the number of Consul servers, by default is 3.

`Ambari Repository config:` you can take the stack RPM's from a custom stack repository
